2. Write the nodes address list to "nodes.txt".

3. And then run "__main__.py". Click the right mouse button, select option "open mode python3.1".

4. The "tun.json" file is automatically generated at the end of the run, which is the profile for single-box.

5. Place the "tun.json" file in the local "Windows IIS server" directory (Path: C:\inetpub\wwwroot),
   so that you have a singbox subscription address.

   Example: http://(localhost)192. 168. 0. 4/tun.json.

6. The"config.json" is a single-box configuration template file, do not delete, do not rename.

7. The"__main__.py" file is the main program, analyzes and extracts the processed node information,
   and auto writes the processed node information into the configuration template,
   finally generates the node configuration file "./ tun.json", do not rename.

8. The"nodes.txt" is the node link storage file, do not delete, do not rename.
